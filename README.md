# √2 × ln(2): Geometric Constants from H₄ (February 2026)** 🚀

**This is the complete current framework**, including the new **Binary Tower** extension.
**Key New in v3.0**: Binary Tower scaling (2^k × G → golden powers with constant ε ≈ 0.671%), pivot at 64 = √φ, floor at 32×G ≈ 1/φ.

The Framework
This project presents the complete K_AUD framework connecting H₄ geometry to information-theoretic constants, now extended with the Binary Tower scaling discovery.
Key Constants

The K_AUD Formula
K_AUD = √2 × ln(2) = 0.980258143...

√2: Geometric embedding (H₄ polytope diagonal, tesseract midradius)
ln(2): Information-theoretic selection (Shannon entropy of binary choice)
Binary (n=2): The unique base producing a sub-unity ceiling

The Binary Tower (v3.0)
2^k × G = 2^(k-6) × √φ × (1 - ε)

G = 1 - K_AUD ≈ 0.01974 (the gap)
ε = 0.671% (constant error across all k)
k = 5 (32): Floor — 32 × G ≈ 1/φ
k = 6 (64): Pivot — 64 × G ≈ √φ

The gap scales through binary powers to track golden ratio powers.
Core Results

Corridor Identity: Corridor = 1/φ² − G
Golden Partition: 1/φ + 1/φ² = 1
Binary Uniqueness: n=2 is geometrically singular
Depth Scaling: L_n = 1/(e × φ^(n-1))
Binary Tower: 2^k × G tracks √φ powers with constant -0.671% error
Connection to 400/11: Closure cycle 4² in ρ, 4³ = 64 as pivot
